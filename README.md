# AutoHotkey Scripts
These are scripts for the AutoHotkey program that I have created and personally find very useful for productivity.

In order to use the script, install AutoHotkey with the installer located at: `~\AutoHotkey Installer\AutoHotkey_1.1.33.09_setup.exe`. OR, navigate to:
`https://www.autohotkey.com/download/` and download/run the installer.

Once you have installed AutoHotkey you may download any of the scripts. Simply double click a script to run it.
